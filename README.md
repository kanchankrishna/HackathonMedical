This website helps out people during this pandemic; it has many features such as being able to email your doctor and ordering a medication list. The About Us page tells the reader about my website; it includes a mission statement, as well as some pictures. The Order Your Medication tab allows a user to order medication directly from the website without any hassle. You can also email your doctor, ask any questions, such as about what time the hospital opens, and give feedback to our website, so we can improve it. You can also sign up for an account if you are new. You can read about how to maintain a healthy lifestyle and be up to date with the latest information on the Corona Virus.
